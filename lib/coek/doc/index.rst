Coek Documentation
==================

Coek is a C++ library for expressing and solving optimization problems.
Coek enables users to express optimization models in C++, interface
directly with optimization solvers, and interact with solutions
generated by solvers.  The design of Coek was broadly inspired by the
object-oriented design in [Gurobi]_, but Coek is designed to support
the expression of mixed-integer nonlinear programs.
