Coek API
========

.. note::
    The API for Coek continues to evolve.  Thus, this documentation contains many references to possible design
    changes and additional features.

Modeling Components
-------------------

There are three classes of modeling components in Coek:

* Elementary Components - These are individual variables, parameters,
  constraints and objectives in the model.

* Indexed Components - These are groups of variables, parameters,
  constraints and objectives that can be referenced with a tuple of
  integers.  There are several different indexing strategies:

  * Multi-dimensional Array - The indices are members of
    a multi-dimensional array, where each dimension is 0-indexed.
    The size of the multi-dimensional array is specified with a tuple
    of per-dimension sizes.

  * Set or Product Set - The indices are members of a set or product
    set that is provided when declaring the indexed component.

The APIs of these classes of modeling components are successively more
complex, so we successively describe each of these classes of modeling
components:
